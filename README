== Building ====================================================================

Build the program with "make". It assumes that "uuagc" is installed. The "futil"
library in the "lib" directory might need to be build and installed using
"cabal" first.


== Source overview =============================================================

/lib
    /futil                              Helper library
/samples                                Sample PHP programs and output generated
                                        by our analyzer.
/src
    Main.hs                             Main module
    /MF
        Analysis.hs                     Generic embelished monotone framework.
                                        Includes the fixed point solver.
        DirectlyRelevantVariables.hs    A monotone analysis used by the program
                                        slicing to find the "directly relevant
                                        variables" as described in [1].
        Program.hs                      An AST for desugared PHP.
        ProgramSlicing.hs               The actual program slicing algorithm
                                        (described below).
    /PHP
        /Simple
            SimpleAST.ag                Attribute grammar working on desugared
                                        PHP. Responsible for constructing the
                                        (inter- and intra-procedural) control
                                        flow.


== Limitations and known issues ================================================

As of the moment of writing we were aware of the following limitations and
issues with our anaylizer:

* All variables are assumed to be local and unshadowed.
* Arrays and objects are not supported.
* Calls to "undefined" functions (i.e. functions not defined in the PHP module
  being analyzed, e.g library functions) do not make its return value depend
  on the actual parameters.
